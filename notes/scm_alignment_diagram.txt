SCM Alignment Flow (Text Version)

1. [User Instruction]
   Example: "Summarize the risks of inference-time compute"

          │
          ▼

2. [Initial Context Embeddings]
   (e.g. prior reasoning steps or retrieved facts)

          │
          ▼

3. [Compute Semantic Centroid]
   = Average(User Instruction + Context Embeddings)
   → This forms the agent's evolving "meaning vector"

          │
          ▼

4. [Candidate Outputs]
   (Generated completions, memory pulls, or tool outputs)

          │
          ▼

5. [Score Candidates via Cosine Similarity]
   Compare each candidate embedding to the semantic centroid

          │
          ▼

6. [Filter or Re-rank]
   Keep only those outputs above a semantic consistency threshold

          │
          ▼

7. [Aligned Final Output]
   → Only semantically relevant completions are passed forward
